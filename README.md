# Thomas's GNU/Linux Dotfiles

There are my dotfiles! The name of the repo, "voidrice", came from the fact they were originally on my Void Linux machine, but these files are distro-independent. In fact, I now push changes from my X200 running Parabola or my X220 running Arch.

## Programs whose configs can be found here
